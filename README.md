# SpaceX-Launch-List
A front-end application which helps user list and browse all launches by SpaceX program

## Technologies
- React JS
- CSS
- Axios

## Description
The app basically starts off with the landing page, where list of all programs are fetched from the api, hence server-side-rendered and displayed in a responsive grid.
User can Filter the results with the help of provided Filters, and when they do, its respective api is called again, and the grid is re-rendered accordingly.

- Did not use any styling frameworks. 
- Fully responsive using CSS only.
- Implemented Mobile First design approach, starting with 300px screen size styles.

### Breakpoints
